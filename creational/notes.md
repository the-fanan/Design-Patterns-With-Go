# Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns help to encapsulate object creation.

## Types of Creational Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
Used when:
- A single shared value of a particular type is needed
- You need to restrict object creaiton to a single unit

### Builder Pattern
Used when:
- Object creation needs to be separated from object user (due to complexity of creating object)
- Reuse object creation algorithm between many objects

### Factory Pattern
Used when:
- You need to delegate creation of new instances to a different part of the program
- You are working at an interface level rather than concrete level
- You are grouping a family of objects into a family object creator

### Abstract Factory
This is basically a factory of factories.
