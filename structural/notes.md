# Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns help us to shape relationships within an application

## Types of Structural Patterns

### Composite Design Pattern
This involves importing other parts of the application or modules for use. This is basically how Go works with packages.

### Adapter Pattern
This follows the Open-Closed principle of OOP. It allows yout to make two incompatible parts of your code to work.
